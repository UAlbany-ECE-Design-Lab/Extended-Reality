What we want out of the meeting:
- We are in the business of not buying the device, but trying to understand how little we can buy
- Or where we should spend our resources

Questions we may ask:
- What are the tools that we need to have to build some applications on this platform 

- Not all platforms are receptive to open-source tools/ open-source methods 

- ML has a lot of open-source tools as part of their development kit 

- Might be an advantage 

- Use a leading example/picture 

- Render a model of a cross-section of a resistor 

- Show this is what we are trying to achieve in the virtual environment 

- What are the tools that are available 

- what is the suite of tools 

- compare to oculus/meta, etc. 

- AR/VR kits 



---- During the Meeting with Mr. Reynaldo Zabala --------
- Open AR/VR exists
- Magic Leap is platform and device-specific
- It's a customized Android platform
- Has its own built-in OS
- Price is about 3400 base level
- Unreal has a lot of better options for visuals and is more favorable in terms of gaming designs. Also uses C++
- Magic Leap has unity applications, has a lot of demonstrations
- It has a lot of built-in materials that we don't necessarily need to start from scratch if we were to use the device
- It comes with a source code
- The supplier's  guidance is to go to forums like Discord server, Reddit or even Telegram to learn and get more resources 
about AR/VR and Magic Leap

Main Focus / Objective of this meeting: To be able to pick up a 3D model within the Environment

- We got a 3D model resistor in the environment and is grabbable.

Next:

- We need it to hve some type of gravitational pull once it is dropped by the user. (Completed)

Then:

- We need to add texture and color on the resistor so that it resembles a resistor in real world. (somewhat done, still learning how)

Then:

- We did a lot of research and experimentations on adding textures. Also, played around fusion360 and getting more and more familiar with UE5

Stakeholder meeting with Professor Dutta and Professor Muckell

- We showcased our progress (a working environment in UE5)
- We are able to grab an electrical component we made in Fusion360 such as resistors and capacitors inside the environment
- Professor Muckell was able to witness and experience what it was like to be in the environment we created.
- They recommend that we take it to another level and have some type of spice/simulation inside it. 
- Our group has an idea on how we will make it educational and engaging.
- Professor Muckell also recommended once this project is up and running that the ECE/CNSE department could potentially showcase it 
during open houses to get more people/incoming students engaged. Sait it could be a good conversation starter (we all agreed)
- We want to create a small breadboard where we can throw in components and have them work as one when they click (something like that)

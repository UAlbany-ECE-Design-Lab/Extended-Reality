# Extended-Reality

Engineering Education with Extended Reality (XR) 
Sponsor: Professor Aveek Dutta, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering 
Desired Skills:  Programming, 3D modeling, and geometric methods 
Description: A big part of the higher education experience in the field of engineering is the hands-on component and learning through experiment.
One of the challenges that has been identified during the COVID-era is teaching courses that have mandatory laboratory components.
In such cases remote teaching and learning is a challenge.
Extended reality (XR) comprising of augmented and virtual reality is envisioned as a key component of experiential learning.
In an effort to integrate XR into laboratory-oriented classes, we need to develop a VR/AR learning platform for fundamental classes within the ECE curriculum.
Professor Dutta seeks a motivated team that will collaborate with his research lab to develop and pilot the first AR/VR lab instruction at University at Albany.
Two main target courses are: 1) Introduction to Circuits and 2) Introduction to Digital Circuits.
Tasks for this project include developing initial requirement analysis and hardware/software requirements to build these applications.
It will involve using some AR/VR equipment and AR/VR development suite for iPhone/android
This will require 3D modelling and associated geometric methods as well as coding skills in iOS and Android.

# Hardware Dependencies
* What hardware would the next team need to replicate your work? Include links to specific equipment when possible.
* Who has the equipment (professor, stakeholder, etc...)? Do they need to purchase anything?
* Is anything needed to be assembled to replicate your work?
* What testing equipment did you use? (if applicable)

# Software Dependencies
* Is there any software necessary to replicate your work?
* Is the software free? If you needed a license, how did you get access?
* Are there any libraries that you used?
* What development environment (IDE) did you use?
* Any difficult set-up or configuration procedures? If so, please document.
* Include links when possible.

# Replication
* How should the next team run your work?
* How would someone know if they successfully replicated your work? What results should they see?
* Does the team need any testing equipment to replicate your results?

# TO-DO
* Provide an example of critical next steps here.
* Bullet point out a few important tasks for the next team to accomplish
* What parts of the project are still work-in-progress? Make sure to clearly indicate this, as to not confuse the team.

# Extended-Reality

[comment]: <> (This is a comment, it will not be included)

Engineering Education with Extended Reality (XR) 
Sponsor: Professor Aveek Dutta, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering 
Desired Skills:  Programming, 3D modeling, and geometric methods 
Description: A big part of the higher education experience in the field of engineering is the hands-on component and learning through experiment.
One of the challenges that has been identified during the COVID-era is teaching courses that have mandatory laboratory components.
In such cases remote teaching and learning is a challenge.
Extended reality (XR) comprising of augmented and virtual reality is envisioned as a key component of experiential learning.
In an effort to integrate XR into laboratory-oriented classes, we need to develop a VR/AR learning platform for fundamental classes within the ECE curriculum.
Professor Dutta seeks a motivated team that will collaborate with his research lab to develop and pilot the first AR/VR lab instruction at University at Albany.
Two main target courses are: 1) Introduction to Circuits and 2) Introduction to Digital Circuits.
Tasks for this project include developing initial requirement analysis and hardware/software requirements to build these applications.
It will involve using some AR/VR equipment and AR/VR development suite for iPhone/android
This will require 3D modeling and associated geometric methods as well as coding skills in iOS and Android.

[comment]: <> (Provide a list of all the contents in this repository. Make it easy for someone to understand what is contained here by briefly describe the contents for each folder/item.)

[comment]: <> (* **REPORT:** All repositories must include a PDF copy of the final report.)
[comment]: <> (* **FINAL PRESENTATION:** Copy of your final presentation slides.)
[comment]: <> (* **SOURCE CODE:** All source code related to the project in a very well-organized fashion.])
[comment]: <> (* **SIMULATIONS:** Include any SPICE, Simulink, or other simulations that will be useful for a future team)
[comment]: <> (* **ANY DELIVERABLES:** Include anything that is relevant and helpful to either the stakeholder or next year's team.)
[comment]: <> (* **PASSWORDS/HOSTNAMES:** Include any usernames, passwords, and/or hostnames that are needed or useful [such as anything on a backend server].

# Hardware Dependencies

* Hardware required is listed via Itemized-Budget.csv
* See:
* 2022 - 2023 Documentation/Research-Citations-Dump/Itemized-Budget.csv

* The 2022 - 2023 XR capstone team provided their hardware.
* Future teams may need to request an order form to acquire the necessary hardware to replicate the project.

* Teams may opt for an alternative option, but further testing is required for compatibility.

* Set-up is required for hardware to enable functionality between hardware and software.
* See:
* "Directory path to set-up documentation/video"

[comment]: <> (* What hardware would the next team need to replicate your work? Include links to specific equipment when possible.)
[comment]: <> (* Who has the equipment [professor, stakeholder, etc...]? Do they need to purchase anything?)
[comment]: <> (* Is anything needed to be assembled to replicate your work?)
[comment]: <> (* What testing equipment did you use? [if applicable])

# Software Dependencies

Software required is listed via Itemized-Budget.csv
* See:
* 2022 - 2023 Documentation/Research-Citations-Dump/Itemized-Budget.csv

* The 2022- 2023 XR capstone team was provided a student plan version of each software.
* Future teams may need to request an order form to acquire the necessary software to replicate the project.

* Teams may opt for an alternative option, but further testing is required for compatibility.

* Set-up is required for software to enable functionality between hardware and software.
* See:
* "Directory path to set-up documentation/video"

[comment]: <> (* Is there any software necessary to replicate your work?)
[comment]: <> (* Is the software free? If you needed a license, how did you get access?)
[comment]: <> (* Are there any libraries that you used?)
[comment]: <> (* What development environment [IDE] did you use)
[comment]: <> (* Any difficult set-up or configuration procedures? If so, please document.)
[comment]: <> (* Include links when possible.)

# Replication

* To replicate the 2022 - 2023 XR capstone team's project
* See:
* "Directory path to set-up documentation/video"

[comment]: <> (* How should the next team run your work?)
[comment]: <> (* How would someone know if they successfully replicated your work? What results should they see?)
[comment]: <> (* Does the team need any testing equipment to replicate your results?)

# TO-DO

* Create a component library for all assets.
* Integrate a spice simulator into UE5.
* Create a simple lesson plan for testing and feedback.
* Create a structural lesson plan for testing and feedback.

[comment]: <> (* Provide an example of critical next steps here.)
[comment]: <> (* Bullet point out a few important tasks for the next team to accomplish)
[comment]: <> (* What parts of the project are still work-in-progress? Make sure to clearly indicate this, as to not confuse the team.)

Our main agenda:
- Finish up Heilmeier questions
- Get our decision matrix done before our meeting with our stakeholder tomorrow
- Finish up the 2 pager


Our main goal for implementing an AR lab environment is to be able to: 
- Explore basic electricity relationships. 
- Explain basic electricity relationships in series and parallel circuits.  
- Use an ammeter and voltmeter to take readings in circuits. 
- Provide reasoning to explain the measurements and relationships in circuits. 
- Build circuits from schematic drawings  
- Determine if common objects are conductors or insulators. 


Focus for the simulation: 
- Series Circuit 
- Parallel Circuit 
- Ohm’s Law 
- Kirchoff’s Law

Start with Elementary Projects such as LED lighting using a battery, LEDs, resistors, breadboard, and some wires. 
- 3D model simple blocks that signify each said component

Introduced Mixed reality and how we can potentially implement that environment with the ideal project.  

Had a meeting with Professor Muckell with the Engineering Design Review for next week:
- Determine the key fundamental requirements for this project
- Draw out visualization
- QR code to integrate
- Build simulation in a physical environment and export it to show a 3D example of the same circuit and play around it virtuually
- Make it interactive and interesting
- One page to send to Muckell by midnight before the design review to handout to students

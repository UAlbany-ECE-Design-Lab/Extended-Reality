Project Kick-off with Prof. Dutta 

- We as a team should know how students can benefit from this project (experimental) 

- Don’t focus on the deliverables  

- He doesn’t know what he wants out of this project (calls it his pet project) Very experimental

 

- See it as a product you want to sell (Mind exercise)

- How much do we have to achieve at the end of the project? 

- Set a goal  

- What does it take to achieve an objective? 

- For Visual Learning – we need to create a sort of library to access components necessary to finish lab work. Progression, set stages to quantify the progression 

- Main target is circuits (Transient analysis, filter response,  1st and 2nd order) 

- Solve human in the loop problem (as this project involes a human in the middle) 

- Human centered project that makes an impact in our lives 

- Adaptive, interactive and interesting way 

- Building block of a concept (to help understand the root of it) 

- All you need to know is ohms law and ODE if we ever focus on circuits 

- Look up snap circuits (fun way to learn about electronics) to get inspo  

- “Education is supposed to be hard” - Dutta 

- We want to make this project functional  

- Set objective, set tasks and execute, show progressions at end of journey. 

- Make sure to define all success points (milestones) even if it’s a small progress 

- George Heilmeier questions to answer  

- I did this ____ and in the processs I learned this ____ 

- Try to find a scientific angle

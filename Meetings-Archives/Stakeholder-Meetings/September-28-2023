September 28, 2023 - Meeting with Prof. Dutta 

 

To find measurable impact/outcome 

How will other people receive it? You have to have people say they like it 

We believe this thing has value and find people who would say the same 

Solution surge (scour internet to see what other people are working on in terms of our project) 

Is it really a valid configuration 

Selling an extended reality environment, not circuit simulation 

Look at rendering objects  

Teaching people how to read colors of resistors (color code) to determine resistance 

Teaching people how to read capacitance and inductance 

Don’t get too hangup on solutions 

**Can you get your user closer to the idea without being physically there?

Another idea (IC reading based on input voltage and what's inside) 

Find value in your work

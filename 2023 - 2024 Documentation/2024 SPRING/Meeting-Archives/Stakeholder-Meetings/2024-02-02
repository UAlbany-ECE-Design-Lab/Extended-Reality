Meeting with our Stakeholder - Professor Dutta

- He gave us a lot of pointers and helpful advice.
- Introduced some SPICE software we could potentially use (PSpice, Cadence, etc.)
- He wanted more visuals inside the environment. 
- He suggested we could create an RLC circuit on VR that shows the bode plot once components with values snap together. (How do you generate that without the lag?)

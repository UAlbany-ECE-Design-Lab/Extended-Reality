Week of February 12

Diego - Focused on implementing hand to object collision
* Created a functional button 
* Implemented Actor to Actor interactions




Joren - Focused on SPICE and a whole lot of research on NGSPice and how we coudl use that to simulate circuit schematics inside our environment.
* I made a simple RC Transient Analysis on NGSpice
- Thought of parsing a netlist file and importing it back to unreal but later learned that I can export a csv file from when I run a simulation on NGSpice and import that back to Unreal. 
- The workflow for this simulation is to: 
get data from asset, export as csv -> turn that csv into a netlist file -> simulate in spice platform (NGSpice) -> export it from spice as csv -> import it back to UE in csv



Daniel - Migrated UE5 Projects to GitHub for ease of access
* Drafted, Designing, and Implementation of UI Menus
* Blueprint Research

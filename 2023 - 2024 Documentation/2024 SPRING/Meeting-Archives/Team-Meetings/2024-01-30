- Deciding on whether or not we want the circuit to be on the wall where each components snap to simulate. 
- Use an array of numbers (values) for each resistor to determine its resistance values in the simulation. 
- Made a blue print for light intensity
- Created a button to collision boxes to manipulate light. Then tested its functionality (being able to toggle on and off)
- We were able to implement blue prints to append light and other variables in our environment. <-- This could be a huge stepping stone to our foundation 
when building the components to snap together. 

Main Focus were:
- Familiarize with SPICE API
- Learn how to snpa all components when nearby
- Do some toggles with light inside UE (basically just play around with it to get used to the environment)

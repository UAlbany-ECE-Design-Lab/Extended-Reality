Project Kick-off with Prof. Dutta 

- We as a team should know how students can benefit from this project (experimental) 

- Don’t focus on the deliverables  

- He doesn’t know what he wants out of this project (calls it his pet project) Very experimental

 

- See it as a product you want to sell (Mind exercise)

- How much do we have to achieve at the end of the project? 

- Set a goal  

- What does it take to achieve an objective? 

- For Visual Learning – we need to create a sort of library to access components necessary to finish lab work. Progression, set stages to quantify the progression 

- Main target is circuits (Transient analysis, filter response,  1st and 2nd order) 

- Solve human in the loop problem (as this project involes a human in the middle) 

- Human centered project that makes an impact in our lives 

- Adaptive, interactive and interesting way 

- Building block of a concept (to help understand the root of it) 

- All you need to know is ohms law and ODE if we ever focus on circuits 

- Look up snap circuits (fun way to learn about electronics) to get inspo  

- “Education is supposed to be hard” - Dutta 

- We want to make this project functional  

- Set objective, set tasks and execute, show progressions at end of journey. 

- Make sure to define all success points (milestones) even if it’s a small progress 

- George Heilmeier questions to answer  

- I did this ____ and in the processs I learned this ____ 

- Try to find a scientific angle  

 


GEORGE HEILMEIER Questions 

1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. What is the problem?  Why is it hard? 

 
2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice? 

 
3. What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful? 

 
4. Who cares? 

 
5. If you’re successful, what difference will it make? What applications are enabled as a result? 

 
6. What are the risks? 

 
7. How much will it cost? 

 
8. How long will it take? 

 
9. What are the midterm and final “exams” to check for success? How will progress be measured?
